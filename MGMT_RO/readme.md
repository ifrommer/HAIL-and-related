# mgmt ro

**<u>Where stuff is</u>:**

**The latest code** (as of 2/3/25, but last worked on months before that) **is capstone2024_v3_idf.py.**
Work off of that file.  
- Don't go crazy refactoring.
- Figure out what it's doing.
- Set up a toy model version by making small data files.
    - See overleaf - I wrote a tiny amount about what to do in this direction.
- And look for low-hanging fruit - it's possible the model is considering assigning MEPS to CBSAs that are **very** far apart.  The potential assignment graph should be sparse.
