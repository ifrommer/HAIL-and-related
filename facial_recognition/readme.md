Use facial recognition to generate metadata tags for videos.  E.g. if "Richard" is in the video, find his face, then add a metadata tag Faces = ["Richard",].

If I embed the face name in the metadata and then post the video to the cloud, it can be read there.  I could use aliases.  Andrea, Garrett, Richard, Scott.  And Jan, Evelyn.  And Jackie, Frank, Candice.
