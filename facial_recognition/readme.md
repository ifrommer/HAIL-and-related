Use facial recognition to generate metadata tags for videos.  E.g. if "Richard" is in the video, find his face, then add a metadata tag Faces = ["Richard",].

If I embed the face name in the metadata and then post the video to the cloud, it can be read there.  I could use aliases.  Andrea, Garrett, Richard, Scott.  And Jan, Evelyn.  And Jackie, Frank, Candice.

at cga, I'm working in ThreePt9 conda env
folder  C:\Users\ifrommer\OneDrive - Coast Guard Academy\Research\CURRENT\ML-AI\00 Computer vision

i'm slowly implementing the code, trying to understand it
it's loading images, looking for faces,doing encodings of them
then later tries to match new unknown faces to the exisitng known ones

Yes, your approach—downloading your Google Photos, using a Python library like face_recognition to identify faces, and writing the names into the metadata—would work well for creating a locally managed, metadata-rich photo collection. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you can achieve this:

Steps to Implement Your Idea
Download Your Google Photos:

Use Google Takeout to export your photos:
Go to Google Takeout.
Select "Google Photos."
Export your photos and download the zip file.
Extract the files to a folder on your computer.
Set Up Python Environment:

### Install the necessary Python libraries:
pip install face_recognition opencv-python pillow exiftool
This didn't fully work, I had to do these:
pip  install pyexiftool
conda install face_recognition

Libraries used:
face_recognition: For face detection and identification.
opencv-python: For handling image files.
Pillow: For image manipulation (if needed).
exiftool: For editing metadata.
Create a Face Dataset for Training:

Gather a few labeled images of each person you want to recognize (Alice, Bob, etc.).
Create a folder structure:
Copy
Edit
```known_faces/
├── Alice/
│   ├── alice1.jpg
│   └── alice2.jpg
├── Bob/
│   ├── bob1.jpg
│   └── bob2.jpg
Write a Python Script to Process Photos: Here’s a basic outline of the script:

python
Copy
Edit
```import face_recognition
import cv2
import os
from exiftool import ExifTool

# Path to known faces
KNOWN_FACES_DIR = "known_faces"
UNKNOWN_FACES_DIR = "google_photos"
OUTPUT_DIR = "processed_photos"

# Load known faces
known_encodings = []
known_names = []
for person in os.listdir(KNOWN_FACES_DIR):
    person_dir = os.path.join(KNOWN_FACES_DIR, person)
    for image_name in os.listdir(person_dir):
        image_path = os.path.join(person_dir, image_name)
        image = face_recognition.load_image_file(image_path)
        encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(image)[0]
        known_encodings.append(encoding)
        known_names.append(person)

# Process unknown faces
for photo_name in os.listdir(UNKNOWN_FACES_DIR):
    photo_path = os.path.join(UNKNOWN_FACES_DIR, photo_name)
    image = face_recognition.load_image_file(photo_path)
    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)
    face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(image, face_locations)

    # Match faces
    names = []
    for face_encoding in face_encodings:
        matches = face_recognition.compare_faces(known_encodings, face_encoding)
        if True in matches:
            match_index = matches.index(True)
            names.append(known_names[match_index])

    # Write names to metadata
    if names:
        with ExifTool() as et:
            tags = {"Keywords": ", ".join(names)}
            et.execute(b"-Keywords=" + bytes(", ".join(names), "utf-8"), bytes(photo_path, "utf-8"))
Output and Verify:

Processed files will now have the recognized names written into their metadata under the Keywords or Tags fields.
Use tools like ExifTool or an online metadata viewer to confirm the metadata updates.
Advantages of This Approach
Local Control:

All processing is done on your machine—no need to rely on Google’s cloud-based features.
Custom Recognition:

You can train the system to recognize specific people, even those not recognized by Google Photos.
Metadata Integration:

Adding names to the photo metadata makes them portable and searchable across platforms like Plex, Apple Photos, or even Windows Explorer.
Challenges to Keep in Mind
Accuracy:

Recognition accuracy depends on the quality and variety of the training images for each person.
Lighting, angles, and occlusions in photos can affect results.
Performance:

Processing a large folder of photos may take time. You can optimize by processing in batches or parallelizing tasks.
Duplicates:

If the same face appears multiple times in a photo, ensure the script doesn’t add duplicate tags.
Next Steps
Test the script with a small subset of your photos.
Experiment with different sets of training images to improve recognition accuracy.
Expand functionality to handle edge cases, such as adding default tags for unrecognized faces.
